# Secure-Instant-Messaging

Instant messaging technology originally aim to offer real-time text communication over the Internet. The message transferred are test-based sentences rather than emails. When one party complete thought and press “send”, another party should receive the message immediately. Now, more advanced instant messaging can provide services such as file transfer, video chat. Of course, the security of transmitted message in medium (usually network) is important. Each user would be distributed an identity, and massages between two parties cannot be grasped by a third party.

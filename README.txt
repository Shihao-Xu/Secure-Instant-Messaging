  Our project is aimed to design and implement a secure Instant Messaging architecture. 
  This implementation is designed in application level and provides integrity, authentication 
and confidentiality for instant messaging. That means the client can be sure whom he is talking 
with and received messages are private and same as origin. Authentication is provided by using 
CA(Certificate Authority) and digital signature. Integrity is provided by digital signatures. 
And Confidentiality is provided by RSA and DES algorithms.

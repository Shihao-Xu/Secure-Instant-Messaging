Here we provide detailed guideline for installation and evaluation of our implementation on 
Windows 10 OS.
Installation:
- Install Python 2.7.15 and set system environment appropriately.
- Download wxpython wrapper.
Excution:
- Open four cmd prompts, run CA.py first then open three GUI by running chattool.py in other 
three cmd prompts.
- In the first interface, click ¡°I am the server¡±. In other two interfaces, change the client 
names and click ¡°I am a client¡±. After the server show two new connections, the whole 
architecture is constructed, and all functions are ready to run.
- In clients¡¯ interfaces, click ¡°Apply certificate¡±. If you get certificate smoothly from the 
CA, ¡°You got certificate¡± notifications will appear. Clients¡¯ consoles will show the detailed 
information of certificates.
- Then click ¡°Exchange Certificate¡± separately on two clients¡¯ interfaces. That causes the 
opposite receiving your own certificate. If certificates are checked to be valid, ¡°certificate 
received¡± notifications will appear, and the system is ready for message exchanging. 
- Now you can choose one client and type any alphabet, number or symbol in the textbox. Click 
¡°Send¡±, your typed information will appear on the screen of another side. Ciphertext can be 
enabled from client interfaces or be monitored from server¡¯s console.
